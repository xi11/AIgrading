# ANORAK_AIgrading
This is an implementation for "This is a simple implementation for "Artificial Intelligence-based grading of lung adenocarcinoma growth patterns" submitted to xxx." submitted to xxx.
This repository could guide you to generate growth pattern masks with a well-trained deep learning model for semantic segmentation, from which the proportion of each growth pattern can be obtained.
Input: H&E image tile, ideally larger than 768 \times 768
Output: Growth pattern mask, black-background, blue-lepidic, yellow-papillary, red-acinar, green-cribriform, magenta-micropapillary, dark red-solid
